# NexaAssistant 🤖  
**AI Agent for Workflow Automation, Knowledge Retrieval, and API-driven Operations**  

NexaAssistant is an **AI-powered assistant** that automates routine operations, manages communication, and retrieves knowledge with accuracy.  
It combines:  
- ⚡ **Workflow Automation** (via n8n)  
- 🧠 **RAG-powered Knowledge Retrieval** (vector DB + embeddings)  
- 🤖 **LLMs for reasoning & natural conversation**  
- 🔌 **API Integrations** (Gmail, Google Calendar, Telegram, Voice APIs, CRMs)  

The result: an AI Agent that can **read, reason, and act** to save time and improve efficiency in an organization.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities  

- 📧 **Email Agent** (via Gmail API)  
  - Reads & summarizes long threads  
  - Drafts context-aware replies  
  - Confirms before sending  

- 📅 **Calendar Agent** (via Google Calendar API)  
  - Creates and manages events/meetings  
  - Adds attendees, generates meeting links  
  - Retrieves upcoming events and availability  

- 💬 **Chat & Voice** (via Telegram + Voice APIs)

  - Replies in natural language or speech  

- 🔍 **Knowledge Agent (RAG)**  
  - Search across documents, notes, and policies  
  - Retrieve facts with context  
  - Reduce hallucinations with retrieval-augmented prompts  

- ⚡ **API-Driven Automation**  
  - Orchestrates multi-step workflows (email → calendar → Slack → CRM)  
  - Calls APIs as tools (send_email, create_event, fetch_data, notify_user)  
  - Logs, retries, and error handling via n8n

## 🧠 RAG + API Pipeline  

1. **Ingest** → parse docs, chunk into embeddings  
2. **Store** → save vectors in ChromaDB / FAISS  
3. **Retrieve** → fetch top-k chunks for a query  
4. **Augment** → build prompt with retrieved context  
5. **Generate** → LLM answers grounded in data  
6. **Act via APIs** → trigger Gmail, Calendar, Slack, CRM, or custom APIs
